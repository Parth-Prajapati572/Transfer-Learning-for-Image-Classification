Developed a multi-class image classification system to distinguish between six different scenes (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea and street) using transfer learning with pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet50, ResNet101, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16). The project involved data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. Achieved 90.76% validation accuracy with EfficientNetB0, outperforming other models.
